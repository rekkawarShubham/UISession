            <h3>Group Selectors</h3>
            Often several selectors in a style sheet share the same style rules declarations. You can group them into a comma-separated list to minimize the code in your style sheet. It also prevents you from repeating the same style rules over and over again

            <h3>Child Selectors</h3>
            A child selector is used to select only those elements that are the direct children of some element.
A child selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by a greater than symbol (>). You can use this selector, for instance, to select the first level of list elements inside a nested list that has more than one level.
